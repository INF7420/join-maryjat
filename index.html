  <h2><a href="about.html">About</a></h2>
  <p> The creation of Mary J. Designs was just a nascent thought when I partook in the digitization of a 1930s plant collection at the University of Michigan. Because of this digital museum initiative, I realized that the best way to engage the increasing connected world in historical or cultural content is to develop digital platforms that allow people from anywhere to access the collections, sites, and research of any cultural institution and museum.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fast forward three years, I decided to pursue a graduate degree in Library and Information Science to advance my expertise in  website design, information sharing, and digital preservation. Mary J Designs took shape as my coursework and museum work began to overlap and I realized that digitization and online interfacing is vital to the reach and impact of museums anywhere in the US. </p>
