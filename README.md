# My INFO 7420 Project

I will develop an online professional portfolio to display my undergraduate, graduate, and professional work. The main purpose of this site is effectively and attractively highlight my work for prospective jobs or consultancy work.

## WIREFRAMES

In order to effectively build my portfolio, I have developed multiple wireframes to help organize the content of my portfolio and develop a consistent structure across all pages.

This is one proposed layout that seems  simple yet sophisticated and may allow for optimal engagement by the user.

### Landing Page
The landing page that all users will first see provides an overview of the different content throughout the portfolio and provides easy-use-tools for communicating.
