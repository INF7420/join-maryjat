          When I completed my first digital project during my undergraduate schooling at the University of Michigan, I knew this was work I wanted to do for the rest of my career. This project involved digitizing a 1930s Hopi Native American collection at the UM Museum of Anthropological Archaeology to repatriate the artifacts; provide the infrastructure for the Hopi to interpret the collection; and ultimately, make the collection more accessible to the Hopi farmers, Hopi community, University students and faculty. It was eye-opening to see how our irreclipable collection could be digitally shared with people, no matter how remote. I realized through this project that the best way I could serve museums and education is to develop digital platforms that allow students to access the collections of museums and historic foundation all over the world.</p>
        <p>
          I am now pursuing a graduate degree in Library and Information science to advance my expertise in  website design, information sharing, and digital preservation to equip me for assisting museums in digitization. I now live in beautiful Charleston, SC where I continue to design websites, mobile apps, and digital content for museums and historic non-profits. I hope to continue to serve these precious storehouses of information and community centers by offering my services in creating accessible, engaging online platforms to increase the impact and reach of each museum and organization.
